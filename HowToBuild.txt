Fetching AGG2 from CVS on SourceForge
-------------------------------------

Fill folder agg2 by doing a CVS update based on :

  :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/vector-agg

where the package name is "agg2". I use TortoiseCVS for this purpose.
Right-click on the empty folder, select "CVS Checkout", specify the
CVSROOT string as stated above, specify "agg2" as the module and press
"OK".


It is also possible to use CYGWIN and execute the following command:

  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/vector-agg checkout agg2

which will produce exactly the same result.



Building the solution
---------------------

Simply build the solution (using Visual Studio .NET 2003).


Modified version of AGG2 files
------------------------------

I have written a modified version of agg_pixfmt_rgba32_image.h, which can
be found in the same named ZIP file. Use it instead of the one provided
by AGG2 if you want proper image border interpolations.
