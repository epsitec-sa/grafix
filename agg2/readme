---------------------------------
Use automake to build the library.

If automake is not available you still can use the old make.
There is a very simple Makefile that can be used. Note that
if you use automake it will overwrite Makefile.
---------------------------------
If building on AmigaOS 4.0 or higher type the following for
instructions on what targets are available.
 make -f Makefile.AmigaOS

To just build and install AGG into the standard AmigaOS SDK
ready for use type:
 make -f Makefile.AmigaOS install

If you just want to build one demo (e.g. lion) use:
 make -f Makefile.AmigaOS bin/lion

If you have any questions about the AmigaOS port please
contact Steven Solie (ssolie@telus.net) for help.
